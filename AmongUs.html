            <h1>Among us</h1>
            <p>Among us is a multiplayer social deduction game where the lobby can consist of anywhere from 4-10 players. The game has 3 different maps which consist of a
                a launch site, on a spaceship and finally on an alien planet. In all the maps the goal is the same, you are either a crew mate; this means you want to 
                complete all your tasks or throw out the imposter, or you are the imposter who is trying to sabotage the game by killing all other players.
