            <h1>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</h1>
            <p>This is a first person shooting game. I have dedicated more time to this game than i would like to admit. The game has recently gone free to play which has brought a lot more players to the game.
                The game is centered around two teams fighting over bomb sites, the two teams are terrorists and counter-terrorists. The objective for the terrorists is to try plant the bomb on the bombsite while
                the counter-terrorists must defend the bombsite and stop them.
            </p>
            <h3>Reasons I like the game</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The game is very competitive which is very appealing to me. </li>
                <li>The game also has a steep learning curve that rewards players that practice and have good muscle memory and reflex's.</li>
            </ul>
